      "Answer: Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions within the input. It addresses the limitation of a single attention head, where averaging can inhibit the ability to capture diverse relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works based on the provided text:\n",
      "1.  **Parallel Attention Layers:** It employs multiple parallel \"attention layers\" or \"heads\" (e.g., 8 in the described work).\n",
      "2.  **Independent Projections:** For each head, the input queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) are first linearly projected into different representation subspaces using separate parameter matrices (W_Q, W_K, W_V for each head).\n",
      "3.  **Individual Attention:** Each head then performs its own attention function (Attention(QW_Q_i, KW_K_i, VW_V_i)) independently on its projected inputs.\n",
      "4.  **Concatenation and Final Projection:** The outputs of all these parallel heads are concatenated together. This concatenated result is then linearly projected once more (using W_O) to produce the final output.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key characteristics and benefits:**\n",
      "*   **Diverse Focus:** It allows the model to capture different types of relationships or focus on different parts of the input simultaneously. Different heads can learn to perform distinct tasks, such as anaphora resolution or identifying structural relationships within a sentence (as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5).\n",
      "*   **Computational Efficiency:** Despite using multiple heads, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality, because the dimension of each individual head is reduced (e.g., `d_k = d_v = d_model / h`).\n",
      "*   **Improved Quality:** Multi-head attention generally leads to better model quality compared to single-head attention, although too many heads can also cause quality to drop.\n",
